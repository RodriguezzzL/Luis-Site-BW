        As a computer science student at California State University San Marcos, I am passionate about learning new
        technologies and applying them to real-world problems. I have skills in software development and C++, which I
        acquired through my coursework and projects. I transferred from Riverside City College, where I completed my
        general education requirements and gained a solid foundation in computer science. I also have four and a half
        years of experience as a lab assistant at Quest Diagnostics, where I supported the laboratory staff with various
        tasks related to instruments, reagents, specimens, and data. I demonstrated exceptional communication and
        customer service skills, as well as attention to detail and quality. I created templates using Microsoft Word
        and Excel to organize and present data, and I diagnosed and repaired non-functioning instruments and computers.
